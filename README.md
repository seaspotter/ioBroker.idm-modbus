## idm-modbus adapter for ioBroker

Connects [IDM](https://www.idm-energie.at) heat pumps (iDM Energiesysteme) with Navigator control to ioBroker locally via Modbus TCP: read, control and feed room, PV and building-automation values. No cloud, one adapter instance per heat pump.

**Manual:** [English](docs/en/manual.md) · [Deutsch](docs/de/handbuch.md)

> **Status: early development.** The Navigator 2.0 (Pro) is verified at a real device for reading and for a few writes. Navigator 1.7 and 10 are built from the IDM documents only and untested. Control, PV, room-temperature and building-automation feeding and the web interface part are off by default.

### Features

- **Reads about 650 documented registers** (temperatures, status, pumps, valves, energy, solar, ISC, cascade, bivalence, PV values, heating circuits A–G, zone modules with up to 8 rooms each) in four polling groups, with one serial connection, a pause between requests and a keepalive: the Navigator stalls under hard polling and closes idle connections after about 10 s.
- **Device scan and detection:** _Test connection_ shows the outdoor temperature and detects the Navigator generation; _Scan device_ reads every register once (read requests only, about 3 minutes, with progress) and _Apply suggestion_ fills in the installation (heating circuits, zone modules, blocks).
- **Clean object tree:** states appear when the Navigator reports a real value, no empty states for hardware you do not have; names in 11 languages; temperatures and counters with one decimal; fault numbers as text.
- **Statistics:** COP and annual performance factor, energy per operating mode, cost and CO₂ (fixed or from a state), operating hours, starts and defrosts, optional external electricity and heat meters; plus runtime, heat and electricity statistics from the Navigator's web pages.
- **Control** (off by default, per group): system mode, hot water, heating circuits, room setpoints and modes (Navigator Pro), solar, bivalence and cascade, and a one-time hot water charge. Every value is checked, limited, read back and counted, with EEPROM protection.
- **Feeding from ioBroker** (off by default): PV values, room temperatures and building-automation values, with scaling, limits, age checks and second-writer detection.
- **Web interface** (optional, PIN): the inputs and outputs of the Navigator (Navigator 2.0 / Pro through its PHP pages, Navigator 10 through its WebSocket) and, on the Navigator 2.0 / Pro, room names, heating circuit names and room data. Modbus values win; the Navigator 1.0/1.7 has no web interface.
- **Heat pump diagram:** a read-only web page (a link next to the instance, served by the web adapter) with a live picture of your plant: heat pump (air or ground source), storage, fresh water station, heating circuits with their rooms, solar, photovoltaics. It assembles itself from the values the adapter has and shows the IDM measuring points (B33, B48, ...).
- **Support file** with one click, without host, PIN or addresses.

### Requirements

Two things have to be set up on the Navigator once, usually at installer/service level, so ask your installer if you cannot reach them:

1. **Modbus TCP** is switched off by default: main menu _Settings_ → _Building management_ (Gebäudeleittechnik) → set _Modbus TCP_ to _On_, and give the Navigator a fixed IP address. Without it nothing works.
2. **Network PIN** – only for the optional web interface part. The adapter works without it.

The adapter does not try to unlock installer functions or change these settings itself.

The heat pump diagram is served by the ioBroker **web adapter**, so it needs one web adapter instance. Everything else works without it.

### Acknowledgements

Big thanks to [Xerolux](https://github.com/Xerolux) for his extensive work on IDM Modbus, the
[idm-heatpump-api](https://github.com/Xerolux/idm-heatpump-api) and
[idm-heatpump-hass](https://github.com/Xerolux/idm-heatpump-hass) projects (MIT). They are this adapter's secondary
reference for register definitions, batching and EEPROM protection, and the best second opinion where the IDM
documents leave questions open.

## Heat pump diagram

A live picture of your plant on a web page, drawn from the values the adapter reads (sample values below). Pipes are coloured and move only where water flows in the current operating mode: orange is the hot flow, blue the return and, while cooling, the cold water; a thin grey pipe carries nothing. Hover over a label to see the name of the IDM measuring point. See the [manual](docs/en/manual.md#8a-heat-pump-diagram) for the settings and every part, and for what the diagram shows when only Modbus is read (no web interface).

## Changelog

<!--
    Placeholder for the next version (at the beginning of the line):
    ### **WORK IN PROGRESS**
-->

### 0.1.17 (2026-10-26)

- (SeaSpotter) diagram: the page no longer stays stale after the connection to the web adapter was interrupted: it shows the current values again after a reconnect (before, only values that changed again were updated), compares all values with the server every minute, tries a failed load again, reopens a connection that stops answering and refreshes when a tab in the background becomes visible
- (SeaSpotter) PV settings: larger block headings, the battery level block lines up with the others

### 0.1.16 (2026-10-25)

- (SeaSpotter) photovoltaics: a fixed block per register instead of a table (a block without a source state sends nothing; the electric heating rod 76 is not offered, the Navigator delivers it itself); existing rows move into the blocks at the first start
- (SeaSpotter) photovoltaics: a source that is missing or too old is written as 0 (battery level -1, not available) so that the Navigator keeps receiving every configured value; warnings at the start for what is not set up
- (SeaSpotter) decimals typed with a point or a comma work in all factor, offset, tolerance, limit and price fields (the number field removed the point while typing); a limit can be cleared by emptying the field

### 0.1.15 (2026-10-20)

- (SeaSpotter) the objects of the web interface (inputs and outputs, rooms) follow the current wording after an update: a renamed part such as the station pump M22 ("Pump hot water station") now also changes on installations that created it earlier (before, only new installations got the name)

### 0.1.14 (2026-10-19)

- (SeaSpotter) diagram: with Modbus only (no web interface) the diagram draws from the best information left and claims no more than it knows: the fresh water station and circuits without a pump state are coloured but not animated, and the dot of such a circuit shows its operating mode; the manuals list what is missing without the web interface

### 0.1.13 (2026-10-16)

- (SeaSpotter) diagram: the heating circuits keep drawing from the heating buffer while the heat pump is off or defrosting, so their pipes show the flow while the circuit pump runs
- (SeaSpotter) diagram: the pipes along the heating circuits flow only as far as the lowest running circuit; the dot on a circuit card is green while the circuit pump runs (not merely while the circuit is in heating mode)
- (SeaSpotter) diagram: the fresh water station box is taller, has its title on top like the other cards and its heat exchanger stands in the middle; the actor M22 is named "Pump hot water station" (Pumpe Warmwasserstation) instead of "Fresh water station"

### 0.1.12 (2026-10-16)

- (SeaSpotter) diagram: a pipe and the label on it are coloured only while water really flows through it; a pipe whose pump is off, or that the operating mode does not use, stays grey

### 0.1.11 (2026-10-16)

- (SeaSpotter) diagram: the flow in a heating circuit follows its pump (M31, M32, ...) instead of its operating mode; the white flow dashes show only while a pipe actually flows

### 0.1.10 (2026-10-16)

- (SeaSpotter) new adapter logo; the fan in the diagram has five blades
- (SeaSpotter) diagram: the pipes of an idle fresh water station, boiler, stove and cascade stay grey; a mixer that reports "Zu" is no longer shown as driven; hot water charging colours the pipes of a combined vessel; the solar labels follow the solar pumps; a cascade that appears later shows without reloading; the size field falls back to the default when empty; the accessibility label of the page follows the language
- (SeaSpotter) manuals: screenshots and a "how to read it" guide for the diagram; integration tests run against the released js-controller

### 0.1.9 (2026-10-16)

- (SeaSpotter) diagram: the plant is drawn by its operating mode: pipes are coloured and move while the heat pump heats, charges hot water or cools, and rest (grey) where they carry nothing; cold water is blue in both flow and return
- (SeaSpotter) diagram: two vessels for a separate heating buffer, a cold storage for cooling, hot water without a heating buffer, a storage layout setting and an adjustable size
- (SeaSpotter) diagram: pump and mixer of every heating circuit, direct circuits, heating rod stages, circulation pump, solar pumps, one dot per compressor
- (SeaSpotter) diagram: oil or gas boiler, tiled stove and cascade of heat pumps with their pipes; names appear when the mouse is over a value label
- (SeaSpotter) the plant description (heat source, hot gas line, storage, cooling, circuits, additions) is worked out from the values the Navigator reports

### 0.1.8 (2026-10-13)

- (SeaSpotter) states are never deleted any more (only switching a register off removes them); the web copy of a part appears whenever Modbus reports no value for it, fixing the missing charging pump M73

### 0.1.7 (2026-10-13)

- (SeaSpotter) diagram: new setting for the source of power and COP (Navigator or external meters, falling back to the Navigator where no external value exists), COP rows setting, thermal power shown, fan label under the icon; external electrical and thermal power as states; translations reviewed in all languages

### 0.1.6 (2026-10-13)

- (SeaSpotter) diagram: the circle of a pump symbol turns green while the pump runs, the hot gas mixer M71 and the fan M13 show as 0-100 % in the heat pump box, the hot gas line moves only while M71 is open and the water moves, the drawing is shown larger

### 0.1.5 (2026-10-13)

- (SeaSpotter) diagram: pumps (M73, M22, M31, source pumps) as a small pump symbol, green while running and grey while off
- (SeaSpotter) diagram: status of the hot gas mixer M71 and of the mixer M41 of heating circuit A; the hot gas line moves while M71 is open

### 0.1.4 (2026-10-13)

- (SeaSpotter) diagram: long labels fit instead of being cut off, wider heat pump box and heating circuit card, the dashes of the circuit pipes run through the junction, a value that appears after the page was opened (the COP) shows without reloading
- (SeaSpotter) diagram: choose the COP in the heat pump box (Navigator, external meters, both or none)

### 0.1.3 (2026-10-12)

- (SeaSpotter) diagram: the return pipe flows from the storage to the heat pump, the water pipes move with the charging pump M73 or the flow sensor B2, heat pump power with one decimal, fresh water station moved right and up

### 0.1.2 (2026-10-11)

- (SeaSpotter) fix: texts the adapter writes into states (scan status, fault texts, operating modes) now follow the system language instead of always being English
- (SeaSpotter) the unit of the price (currency or cent per kWh) and of the CO₂ factor (g or kg per kWh) can be chosen, for the fixed value and for the state
- (SeaSpotter) the scan status text stands next to the progress

### 0.1.1 (2026-10-11)

- (SeaSpotter) maintenance: the web adapter is listed as a requirement of the heat pump diagram, consistent German name of the diagram, safer translation tooling

### 0.1.0 (2026-10-11)

- (SeaSpotter) initial release: reads the IDM Navigator over Modbus TCP (Navigator 2.0 / Pro verified on a device; Navigator 10 and 1.0/1.7 from the IDM documents, untested), with device scan, statistics, optional control, PV and room feeding, optional web interface values and a live heat pump diagram, texts in 11 languages
